# Protfy - Portfolio Management Application

A smart portfolio tracking and analysis tool that helps investors manage their stock investments with AI-powered insights.

## Features

- **Stock Search**: Find stocks from global markets using Yahoo Finance data
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Add stocks to your portfolio and track their performance
- **Live Price Updates**: Monitor current prices and changes in your holdings
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Get AI-powered analysis of your investment strategy

## Vercel Limitation
The project is currently hosted on vercel and it limits server function execution duration to 10s therefore i cannot use any high quality model for analysis
Please set up project locally and use good AI models (even gemini2.0 you can get free api) as i am limited to using old gemini 1.5 8b lowest offering by gemini.
You can change model by doing one-line edit in src/app/api/analyse/protfolio and editing const model.
